[[integrate_filtering_support_for_approximate_nearest_neighbor_search]]
=== Integrate filtering support for approximate nearest neighbor search

The {ref}/knn-search-api.html[_knn_search endpoint] now has a "filter" option
that allows to return only the nearest documents that satisfy the provided
filter.

[[nlp-latency-throughput-stats]]
=== NLP latency and throughput stats

New statistics are available for the NLP inference to show how quickly it is
working. The three new statistics are:

* peak_throughput_per_minute
* throughput_last_minute
* average_inference_time_ms_last_minute

The aim is to provide an indication of whether inference is currently keeping up
with requirements or the cluster needs to be scaled up to meet demand. The
statistics for the last minute give quick feedback to show the effect of scaling
the {ml} nodes.

[[random-sampler-aggregation]]
=== Random sampler aggregation

With the new random sampler aggregation, in technical preview, developers can
exponentially accelerate their aggregations for calculations, with a slight
trade off in accuracy, by randomly sampling documents in a statistically robust
manner. The random sampler aggregation can be used to accelerate any application
that utilizes aggregations for calculations.
